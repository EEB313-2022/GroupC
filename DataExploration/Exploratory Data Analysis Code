This Notebook contains the code used to analyze the data from the study

```{r}
# Import libraries for ggplot 
library(dplyr)

Exploratory Data Analysis 1: Graphing Relative abundance of native specie(slimy sculpin) and the Round Goby 
```{r}
# Getting Rid of Unneccessary Columns that are not applicable to 
# current data analysis
curated_data <- data %>% 
  select(-c(opId,vesselName,serial, opDate, speed_mpsec, wingSpreadModeled_m,extraBottomContactTime_sec, areaSampledDoors_m2, lifeStageName, fishingDepth_m, towTime_min, fishingTemperature_C, latitude, longitude, n))
```
```{r}
# grouping by desired species and year of collection
total_weight_by_species <- curated_data %>% 
  group_by(commonName, year) %>% 
  filter(commonName %in% c("Round Goby", 
                           "Slimy Sculpin")) %>% 
  tally(weight_g) %>% 
  # current weight is measured in grams; change to kg 
  
  mutate(kg_weight = n/1000)

# plotting by year and collected biomass; lines represent the two species 
graphed <- total_weight_by_species %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= year, y = kg_weight, colour=commonName)) + 
           geom_line()+ labs(title ="Yearly Collected Biomass of the Round Goby and Slimy Sculpin in Lake Ontario \n From 1997-2022", x="Year of Collection", y="Total Biomass Surveyed(in Kilograms)") + theme_classic() 
graphed 
```
From the Graph, we can see a decline in collected slimy sculpin biomass 
compared to Round Goby biomass, although the goby population appears to be in
flux(with a extremely large increase in recent years). Perhaps other factors
are at play? We will explore relationships such as temperature and biomass, and
how different sites potentially also impacts biomass.
