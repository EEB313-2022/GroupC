# Invasive Neogobius melanostomus(Round Goby) and its Impact on Native Fauna Biomass

## Abstract/At a Glance
The Neogobius melanostomus, or the round goby, is a bottom-dwelling, small, saltwater species native to the Caspian Sea in Eastern Europe. A very aggressive and 
prolific breeder, this alien species is thought to have lead to the decline of native species that occupy a similar niche[^1]. Due to the changing climate of the Great Lakes, as the temperatures of the Great Lakes begin to match those of the Caspian, we want to see/predict if there will be any changes to species abundance within the Great Lakes.

This project is based upon a extended study conducted in various site in Lake Ontario since 1978, where species were collected from the bed, measured, and tallied[^2]. We aim to compare several variables. The main 3 are the abundance of the Round Goby (an invasive species in the great lakes region), the water temperature, and the abundance of native fish species (sculpin, and logperch but weâ€™d love to look at more if we have time) that occupy a similar niche. We want to find out if there is any correlation between changing temperature and the abundance of these 3 species. Furthermore, we hope to determine if the presence of the round goby is influencing the native species. We hope this will help understand the threats faced by native species and whether they are more threatened by the round goby or by the temperature, or both. The data was collected from various points in Lake Ontario, and we hope to also find any differences between sites.
